NYSE: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques:

Among the top portfolio, Apple Inc is one of the highest bid stock, there share price is increasing beyond the point of termination. Applied Statistician and Trader finds difficult to handles these non-linearity function which make to push down the monthly trading target. they applies some state of the art statistical techniques to predict bids. Here is one of the state of the art machine learning model that will help trader to get it target bid across the market in a day.

In this repository, i introduces the fundamental analysis of the stock market. Dataset is collected fro NYSE :{ New York Stock Exchanges }, for last 6 months and consists of majors columns such as :


    * Open: The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading 
    day for example, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opens at precisely 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. The price of the first  
    trade for any listed stock is its daily opening price. 
    
    * Close: The close is the end of a trading session in the financial markets when the markets close. It can also refer 
    to the process of exiting a trade or the final procedure in a financial transaction in which contract documents are 
    signed and recorded.
    
    * High: Today's high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day. Today's high is 
    typically higher than the closing or opening price. More often than not this is higher than the closing price.
    
    * Low: A 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price at which a stock has traded during the previous year. It is a    
    technical indicator used by some traders and investors who view the 52-week high or low as an important factor in 
    determining a stock's current value and predicting future price movement.
    
    * Volume: In capital markets, volume, or trading volume, is the amount of a security that was traded during a given  
    period of time. In the context of a single stock trading on a stock exchange, the volume is commonly reported as the 
    number of shares that changed hands during a given day.
